## Terrain_Wizard
The goal of this project is to create objects based on real-world data and enable interaction with a virtual world. By using a depth camera,
an input device that can transmit more information than a keyboard and mouse,
we expand the data transfer capacity between the user and the computer.
Instead of predefined objects,we construct objects based on real-world 3D data and implement a real-time rendering pipeline.
